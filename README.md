# Roll-In!
"Roll-In!" is a 3d plateform game using OpenGL and freeglut.

## How to play the game?
First of all:
```git clone https://github.com/Ouass77ck/Roll-In-```
Then, make sure to have *GLUT* and *SFML* installed.
Now you can either use CodeBlocks and simply build and run the cbp file. Or you can use a linux terminal and run it with the compiler of your choice (I used GCC).

## More:
If you want you can design your own level by adding as many plateforms as you want into the `initObstacles` function:
`Obstacle platform_name = {xfloat, yfloat,zfloat, widthfloat, heightfloat, depthfloat, 2};`
`obstacles.push_back(platform1);`
